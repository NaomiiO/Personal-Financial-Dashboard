📊 A Personal Spending Dashboard Analysis (Jan–May 2025)

 1. Overview
Brief summary of what the project is:

I tracked and analyzed my personal spending using Excel to uncover habits, leaks, and forecast my financial path. This report includes dashboard screenshots, pivot analysis, and a simple forecast to simulate August outcomes if current trends continue. This is a fully interactive dashboard.

 2. The 5Ws & H
What: A self-analysis of personal spending using Excel dashboards.
Why: To understand my financial habits and simulate future outcomes if current behavior continues.
When: Transactions from January – May 2025
Where: Spending data across different banks (Fidelity & OPay)
Who: Me – as both the user and analyst.
How: Built pivot tables, dynamic slicers, calculated trends, and forecasted future spending.

3. Tools Used
Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Forecast Sheet, Slicers)
Manual data cleaning
Design styling for clarity

 4. Key Questions Answered
Include bullet points for each insight:
- What are my top 3 spending categories?
- Which day of the week is most expensive?
- Which platform charges me the most?
- How does my monthly spending trend look?
- If I continue this way, what will I have left by December?

 5. Results Summary
Between January and May 2025, I spent the most on POS purchases and airtime. Fidelity Bank charged me 4x more than OPay. 43% of my spending was unaccounted for (tagged as “Others”), suggesting I need stricter budget tracking. If my spending pattern continues, I’ll end the year with a significant deficit.
Forecasted Year-End Balance: –₦394,500
